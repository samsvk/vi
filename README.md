## About the Project

> Vivi is a digital artist with a large growing fanbase. As Vivixstar became
> increasingly popular they understood they required a website to not only display
> their digital art but also help it become easier for customers to purchase
> commissions. This lead to me building a masonry grid display and a complex price
> calculator.
